Medical Software Design (Duke BME590)
=====================================

Overview
--------
Software plays a critical role in almost all medical devices, spanning device
control, feedback and algorithmic processing.  This course focuses on software
design skills that are ubiquitous in the medical device industry, including
software version control, unit testing, fault tolerance, continuous
integration testing and documentation.  Experience will be gained in both
dynamically- (Python) and statically-typed (C/C++) languages.

The course will be structured around a project to build an Internet-connected
medical device that measures and processes a biosignal, sends it to a web
server, and makes those data accessible to a web client / mobile application.
This project will be broken into several smaller projects to develop software
design fundamentals.  All project-related work will be done in groups of 3
students.
