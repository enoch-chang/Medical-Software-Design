Group Exercise
--------------
You will work in your groups for this exercise.  Before you start this exercise, make sure you setup your username and email address for git repositories: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/

1. Have one group member create a repository named `bme590lecture02` with a file called `README.md`.
2. Add the two other group members as collaborators.
3. Create three issues:
  a. Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
  b. Add `LICENSE` file.
  c. Add a `.gitignore` file.
4. Have the other group members clone the repository locally.
5. Have one group member create a branch named `$USERNAME/$BRANCHNAME-RELATED-TO-ISSUE` and the other group member create a branch named `$USERNAME/$BRANCHNAME-RELATED-TO-ISSUE`.  The repository owner can work on the third issue.
6. Have each group member:
  a. Create a commit message that references (`closes`) the appropriate issue.
  b. Push each branch to `origin`.
  c. Create a Pull Request to the repository owner.
7. Review and merge each Pull Request into `master` on GitHub.
8. Have each group member pull the latest `master` branch to their local computer.
9. Confirm that each file that was commited is available.
10. Review the commit log on GitHub and your local repository.
