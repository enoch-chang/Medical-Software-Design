# Development Tools
## VIM Workflow:
VIM is the default text editor that `git` will use when generating / editing
commit messages.  You can change this, but if you start using VIM, some basics:
* `vim filename`
* Type `i` to go into Insert mode (how you can edit your file)
* Type `ESC` to exit Insert mode and go into Command mode
* Type `:w` - write file
* Type `:q` - quit
* :sparkles: Shortcut :sparkles: Combine write and quit in one command: `:wq`

Want to configure your VIM environment to look like Dr. Palmeri's VIM setup?
